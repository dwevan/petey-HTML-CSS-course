# Resources for Assigment 1

## Screens
See the `screens` folder for a screenshot of each image

## Images
I have included the images from "Hotel Hobbit Hole" inside the `img` folder

## Icons
We are using FontAwesome here! You will need to include the following line within your head:

```html
<script src="https://kit.fontawesome.com/a1f8a6480e.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

We can then include an icon using:

```html
<i class="fas fa-ring"></i>
```

We can increase the size by setting a `3x` class or the size you want

```html
<i class="fas fa-ring fa-3x"></i>
```

## Font
I have used the `Open Sans` Google font but feel free to use one of your choice!
